This project demonstrates **API Integration** and **Data Visualization** using Python.  
It fetches 5-day weather forecast data from **OpenWeatherMap API** and visualizes temperature trends.

Built using Python, OpenWeatherMap API, Matplotlib, Seaborn & Visual Studio Code

This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API into a Python application and convert real-time data into meaningful visual insights. I implemented this project using Visual Studio Code, where I wrote the Python script, installed required libraries, executed the program, and visualized the results. The project fetches 5-day weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API and plots the temperature variation using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The core objective of this project is to learn and demonstrate how to perform API Integration and Data Visualization, two important concepts in modern software development and data analysis. By working with real-time API data, I gained hands-on experience in making API requests, handling JSON responses, validating API keys, and resolving common API-related errors. I also learned to clean, extract, and structure the data before visualizing it.


**Tools and Technologies Used**

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – for writing and executing the Python code
Python 3.x – primary programming language
OpenWeatherMap API – weather forecast data provider
Requests – for making API calls
Matplotlib – for creating data visualizations
Seaborn – to enhance the visual style of the plot


**Features of This Project**

Fetches 5-day weather forecast (40 data points at 3-hour intervals).
Extracts temperature and timestamps from JSON API response.
Converts UNIX timestamps into readable date/time format.
Plots temperature variations using a line graph.
Clean, organized, beginner-friendly Python code.
End-to-end project execution in Visual Studio Code.


**How I Built This Project**

I began by setting up a working Python environment in VS Code. After installing Python 3.13, I configured VS Code to use that interpreter. Next, I installed the required libraries using the terminal:

pip install requests matplotlib seaborn

After this, I created a Python file (main.py) and implemented the API integration by forming a correct API request URL using my OpenWeatherMap API key.
While running the code initially, I encountered errors like ModuleNotFoundError for packages and 401 Invalid API Key. These issues helped me understand how to correctly install Python libraries, verify the VS Code interpreter, and validate an API key. Once the API key was activated and the response structure was verified by testing the URL in the browser, the Python script successfully fetched weather data.
Finally, after extracting the temperature and date information from the JSON response, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create a smooth, readable temperature forecast graph.
